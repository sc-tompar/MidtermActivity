    The **Adult Income Dataset** is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).
    This dataset compiles census data aimed at predicting whether an individual earns over $50,000 a year based on various demographic and employment variables.
    
    The dataset consists of 32,561 entries with 15 attributes (features), ranging from age and education to working hours and occupation, along with one target variable (income).
    
    This report is prepared by the **Sheeshable Guys** team and aims to explore key factors that influence income levels among adults.

    ### üèÅ Key Insights from the Data Exploration:
    
    - **Age**: The average age of individuals is around 38.5 years, with a majority falling within the range of 28 to 48 years.
    
    - **Income**: Only about 24% of the individuals earn more than $50,000 annually, indicating income disparity.
    
    - **Education**: The average education level is around 10 years, which aligns closely with a high school education.
    
    - **Work Hours**: Most individuals work a standard 40-hour work week, indicating typical full-time job schedules.
    
    - **Capital Gains/Losses**: The majority of individuals have zero capital gains or losses, with a small number of significant outliers.
    
    ### üîç Future Recommendations:
    
    1. Focus on analyzing the relationship between occupation and income.
    2. Explore the impact of marital status and education on income levels.
    3. Consider creating predictive models to understand income mobility.
